# KotlinTest
An android app to test different functionalities and libraries using kotlin.

This app was an attempt to check how to use different components of android and libraries in Kotlin way. This app can help people to
understand how to work with DrawerLayout, Fragment(and communication in between them), KotterKnife(Butterknife for Kotlin), EventBus,
ObjectBox, RxJava, Retrofit etc.

Feel free to contribute. This is just a sample project so a lot of standards are not maintained.
